# NXRM3 Maven Staging Plugin

This plugin allows Maven projects to be staged in a Nexus Repository Manager 3 repository.

# Example configuration

The basic build configuration requires a url (nexusUrl), repository to deploy (repository) and a server (serverId).
```
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.sonatype.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>nexus-staging-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
        <configuration>
          <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081</nexusUrl>
          
          <!-- The server "id" element from settings to use authentication from settings.xml-->
          <serverId>local-nexus</serverId>
         
          <!-- Which repository to deploy to -->
          <repository>maven-releases</repository>
          
          <!-- Skip the staging deploy mojo -->
          <skipNexusStagingDeployMojo>true</skipNexusStagingDeployMojo>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
```

To override the default deploy goal add the following to the plugin. This can be used if more control is desired over 
when the plugins deploy goal is activated. 

```
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>default-deploy</id>
            <phase>deploy</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>deploy</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
```

# Example usage

The plugin allows a tag to be specified via ```-Dtag``` or as a parameter in the plugin configuration in the pom file.

e.g. ```mvn install nexus-staging:deploy -Dtag=test``` or 

```
<plugin>
    ...
    <configuration>
      ...
      <tag>...</tag>
       ...
```

If no tag is specified, one will be generated in the format:
 
 ```<artifactId>-<version>-<timestamp>``` 

e.g. ```myproject-1.5.7-1550242817039```

# Mutation testing

Run ```mvn -DwithHistory org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage``` to calculate mutation coverage. This needs to be 
run from inside the maven-plugin directory rather than at the root of the project to detect the tests.

# Integration testing

To run the integration tests against a docker instance specify the port you would like the tests to run on:

```-Dnexus.it.port=8085``` 

e.g. ```mvn clean install -Dnexus.it.port=8085```

To run the integration tests against a local instance use the profile ```local-nexus3```

e.g. ```mvn clean install -Plocal-nexus3```
